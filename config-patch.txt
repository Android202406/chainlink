-FinalityTagEnabled means that the chain supports the finalized block tag when querying for a block. If FinalityTagEnabled is set to true for a chain, then FinalityDepth field is ignored.

+FinalityTagEnabled will mean that the chain supports the finalized block tag when querying for a block. If FinalityTagEnabled is set to true for a chain, then FinalityDepth field will be (once fully
+implemented) ignored: finality for a block will be solely defined by the finality tags provided by the chain's RPC API. This feature is new and still only partially implemeneted. LogPoller respects it,
+but HeadTracker still relies on FinalityDepth which must be set to something sensible even if FinalityTagEnabled = true.
